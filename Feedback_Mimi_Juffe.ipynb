This is because it is difficult to do math on words so when you are doing your analysis you will need to differentiate response times on trials with teh target and trials without the target and its just easier for the analysis when those are numbers. Also easier to check whether it is truly half/half with 0 and 1 when you have a large amount of trials. "

    "By using a class the Exp-Feedback is a lot more effecient. Instead of having to call multiple functions like I had to they just had to run one class object and it looped through that one class object with the inner class methods already in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a dictonary and calling specific keys to compute the averages and display them is really effecient, as well as just adding all the rts and accuracies toegther upfront, then adding them to a dictonary with the set size condtion as the key. Which allows an easier time computing the averages per condition instead of creating a list like I did and then having to get the sum and then the average for everything. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Exp-feedback should have something that closes the window and quits at the end of the experiment after it shows the overall feedback on screen. Also another thing I noticed about the experiment is there were no practice trials. The feedback-exp could have made a seperate class for practice trials and then made an object for that class and initialized it before the actual trials loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I did notice about both of our code is that our naming conventions are sometimes confusing for example I had trial in total_trials and rt and response_times, and the feedback-Exp had distractors and Distractors. This can be really confusing and lead to mistakes when working through it (or going back and fixing things)."
