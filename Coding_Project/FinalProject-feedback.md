# PSYC 5P02- Introduction to Programming for Psychology

### Fall 2025
### Final Project Evaluation


#### Overall grade: 85%

---
#### Coding style/Clarity:
* Code is mostly clean and clear. 
* I like your use of functions
* Some hard-coding of values that may make more sense as variables
:memo: **check/check+** 

#### Coding efficiency:
* Despite the use of functions there is a lot of repeated code that could be made more efficient. 
:memo: **check-/check**

#### Documentation:
* Could have benefited from a readme file that describes how to interact with the scripts. Especially given that I needed to set up a montior for the task. Could have also used some help files in scripts/functions. 
:memo: **check**

#### Complexity, scale of tasks/analysis, and mastery:
* Task and analyses were moderately complex. Some intricacies but nothing far beyond what has previously been covered by other assignments
 :memo: **check**

#### Completeness:
* Task needed to set up a monitor which caused an error on first running
* No other friction. Only critique is it would be easier to access as a stand-alone repository.
 :memo: **check**
