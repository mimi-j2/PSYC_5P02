**Question 1:** 
a) What command would you use in a terminal shell if you wanted to list the files in your current directory, sorted in reverse order of when they were last edited? 
ls -rt
rt reverses the order of the sorting by time (so it starts from oldest and ends on most recent file edited)
b) How would you expand on this command to also provide the date and time the file was last edited?
ls -lrt
by adding l it gives you additional information on each file such as date and time it was last edited. It also gives you additonal information like size of file, file owner, group, date modified, and who can access and edit the file.

c) Provide the manual description of at least one of the options required to produce this result.

  -l = use a long listing format
  -r =  reverse order while sorting
  -t = sort by time, newest first;

**Question 2:** If your "home directory" is ```/users/yourname/```, provide three different commands that you can use to navigate from the directory ```/users/yourname/documents/``` to your home directory: 
  
  cd ~/
  cd home 
  cd ../ (if you do this it will take you to the directory above which is the home directory)
  or can also do cd /users/yourname/ to get to the home directory

**Question 3:** Provide the commands to do the following (in order):
* Make a directory called 'Data'
* Create a file called 'subj01.txt'
* Create four copies of the file you just created for subject 2 - 5, as well as 11.
* Move all of the files into the 'Data' directory
* Delete all .txt files from the Data directory **except** for subj11.txt

**Question 4:** Using the manual to learn about the function, create a _pipe_ that uses the ```tee``` command. Describe the task you're aiming to perform, and provide any and all code needed to complete it. Be sure to upload any files that you needed to run this code.

**Question 5:** Using the ```screen`` command, open up a screen. Using the ```history``` command and a pipe, write your command history to a file. Then exit the screen, and write your history to a new file again. Are these files the same? Why or why not? (Be sure to name them something obvious and upload both files as part of this assignment.)

**Question 6:** Complete the Introduction to Github tutorial at https://skills.github.com/. Screenshot the message you receive when you complete the tutorial, and insert the image into your markdown file. Hint: your image will need to exist in the same path as your saved markdown file, and your code will take the form of something like: ``![This is a picture of my screenshot](screenshot.jpg)``

**Question 7:** Go to the class respository (https://github.com/SMEmrich/PSYC-5P02-2025). Using the *fork* button at the top of the page, create a fork of the class respository.
